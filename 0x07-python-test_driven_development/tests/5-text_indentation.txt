 How to Use text_indentation
===============================

This library is very simple, since it only has one function called
``text_indentation()``.

Normal Case
================

    >>> text_indentation = __import__('5-text_indentation').text_indentation
    >>> text_indentation("hello?") 
    hello?
    <BLANKLINE>

    + No spaces are printed at the beginning of a line.
    
    >>> text_indentation("   Hi there.")
    Hi there.
    <BLANKLINE>
