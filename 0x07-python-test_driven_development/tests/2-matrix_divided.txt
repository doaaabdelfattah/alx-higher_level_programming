 How to Use matrix_divided
===============================

This library is very simple, since it only has one function called
``matrix_divided()``.

Numbers
=======
For numbers,
that value is equivalent to using the ``\`` operator.

::

    >>> matrix_divided = __import__('2-matrix_divided').matrix_divided
    >>> matrix = [[1, 2, 3],[4, 5, 6]]
    >>> print(matrix_divided(matrix, 3))
    [[0.33, 0.67, 1.0], [1.33, 1.67, 2.0]]

===========================

    >>> matrix = [[3, 6, 9],[12, 15, 18]]
    >>> print(matrix_divided(matrix, 3))
    [[1.0, 2.0, 3.0], [4.0, 5.0, 6.0]]

===========================
It also works with floating-point values.

    >>> matrix = [[3.1, 6, 9],[12, 15, 18]]
    >>> print(matrix_divided(matrix, 3))
    [[1.03, 2.0, 3.0], [4.0, 5.0, 6.0]]

===========================
It gives TypeError message with Non-Numbers

    >>> matrix = 55
    >>> print(matrix_divided(matrix, 3))
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    TypeError: matrix must be a matrix (list of lists) of integers/floats

    >>> matrix = [3, 5, 7]
    >>> print(matrix_divided(matrix, 3))
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    TypeError: matrix must be a matrix (list of lists) of integers/floats

    >>> matrix = [3, 'p', 7]
    >>> print(matrix_divided(matrix, 3))
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    TypeError: matrix must be a matrix (list of lists) of integers/floats

    >>> matrix = [[3, 'p', 7],[5, 7, 9]]
    >>> print(matrix_divided(matrix, 3))
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    TypeError: matrix must be a matrix (list of lists) of integers/floats

    
+++++++++++++++++++++
It gives TypeError message if matrix not the same size of rows

    >>> matrix = [[3, 7],[5, 7, 9]]
    >>> print(matrix_divided(matrix, 3))
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    TypeError: Each row of the matrix must have the same size
    
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++
It gives TypeError message if div isn't number or floating

    >>> matrix = [[3, 6, 9],[12, 15, 18]]
    >>> print(matrix_divided(matrix, 's'))
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    TypeError: div must be a number

    >>> matrix = [[3, 6, 9],[12, 15, 18]]
    >>> print(matrix_divided(matrix, 0))
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    ZeroDivisionError: division by zero
